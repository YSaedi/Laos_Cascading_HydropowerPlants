Introduction to Laos Cascade Hydropower Plants in OSeMOSYS
==============================================================

Modelling and planning the cascade hydropower system in terms of sustainable energy modelling has been a challenging decision to make due to the complexity of the multi-reservoir water system. This documentation represents tools for modelling cascading hydropower plants (HPP) using Open Source energy MOdelling SYStem `(OSeMOSYS)  <https://github.com/OSeMOSYS/OSeMOSYS_GNU_MathProg/blob/AlternateStorageCode/src/osemosys_short.txt/>`_. This project includes seven cascade HPP located on Nam Ou river in order to model energy system with a representation of the cascading hydro facilities in Lao PDR. OSeMOSYS is used due to its flexibility, functionality, and availability to run and interpret modelling scenarios. 

Lao PDR Case Study
--------------------------------------
Lao generates 85% of its electricity from hydro-electric power plants including a significant share of cascading hydro facilities. Laos is now seen as one of the richest countries in south-east Asia in terms of hydropower resources due to its geographical location and annual perception. Cost-effective energy and exporting power generated by hydropower significantly contribute to economic growth in Lao.

Structure of Model
====================================
In the following sections, a detailed explanation of open-source tools, instructions and information to model the cascade hydropower system are provided.

    Note: `OSeMOSYS_2017_11_08 <https://github.com/OSeMOSYS/OSeMOSYS_GNU_MathProg/blob/AlternateStorageCode/src/osemosys_short.txt/>`_ includes storage equations that are proper to make relationships inside the cascading hydropower plant modelling.

RES of Cascading Hydropower Plants
------------------------------------------
The Reference Energy System (RES) of the developed model simplifies the complexity of the generation of hydroelectricity from 7 cascading hydropower plants located on one river, illustrated in Figure 1. It 1 consists of technologies, energy carriers, fuels, and various levels of energy in the supply-demand chain. RES starts with Rain technology on the left side of the chain connected to the River Water. All required components of RES to model cascading hydropower plants are represented below:

TECHNOLOGY
...............................................

Technology in OSeMOSYS refers to components of the system that make a change to the commodities, which is water and electricity in this model, including transforming, using, or supplying.

|Rain        | It includes rainfall in a specific watershed shown in brown boxes in Figure 1. This model starts with Rain technology producing the River Water, which is defined as its output fuel.                                                                                                               |
+------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
|River    | the natural river in the watershed is defined as River technology represented in blue boxes in Figure 1. The input fuel of this technology is the River Water produced by the Rain technology. The River is modelled in OSeMOSYS as **Technology To Storage** since it provides the required water for dams that are introduced in the model as the Storage. |
+--------------------+--------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Hydropower Plant | Hydroelectric facilities are connected to the Storage and take the River Water as input fuel to produce electricity. Hydropower plant technology is modelled as the **Technology From Storage** and illustrated in navy blue boxes in Figure 1 |
+--------------------+--------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Power Transmission| Once the electricity is generated it is transmitted to address end-user demands. It is shown in gray boxes in figure 1. |
